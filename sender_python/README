in order to get the current state of this folder, the following must be done

1) git clone git://github.com/twilio/twilio-python.git
2) git clone https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py.git

3) in each of the folders, run "sudo python setup.py install"
4) copy the contents of both folders into one location
5) add Sender.py to that location

MISSING: 
a) configuration of the redis server
b) format of the messages from the redis server
c) parsing of the messages into strings so that twillio accepts it

NOTE: twillio is currently hardcoded with my info - if we run out of money, one of us will have to register another account
