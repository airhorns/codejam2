.SH SYNOPSYS
.nf
.B #include <cgi.h>

.SH DESCRIPTION
This routine returns a pointer to a datastructure associated with the
value of a CGI file variable.  The pointer must not be freed.

The
.I s_file
structure is declared as follows:

.RS
.nf
typedef struct file_s {
    char   *name,
           *type,
           *filename,
           *tmpfile;
} s_file;
.fi
.RE

Memory allocated by this data structure is automatically freed by the
final call to
.BR cgiFree (3).
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success a pointer to the
.I s_file
datastructure is returned.  If the variable wasn't transmitted or the
through CGI or if the filename was empty NULL is returned.
.SH "AUTHOR"
