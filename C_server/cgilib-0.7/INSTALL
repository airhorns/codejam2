Installation Instructions
=========================

The version control system does not contain all files required to
compile this project.  This is intentional.

These files will be added before releasing a new version of the
package outside of the version control system.

Compiling from Source
---------------------

To compile this package you'll have to execute the following two
commands:

./configure
make

Compiling from CVS
------------------

Before you can compile this project you'll have to install the
following packages:

 . autoconf
 . automake
 . libtool

Once installed you'll have to execute the following commands:

aclocal
autoconf
libtoolize --force
automake --add-missing --foreign

Now ./configure is generated and needs to be executed.

Preparing a release
-------------------

After the final commit, edit configure.ac and adjust the package version.
Run the following commands:

aclocal
autoconf
libtoolize --force --copy
automake --copy --add-missing --foreign

Before building the final release tarball some files may be removed.

After a normal build run, execute:

make distclean
rm -rf autom4te.cache
rm -f aclocal.m4
